Game 1: Tic Tac Toe 
###################

You need to implement the famous two player game Tic Tac Toe using your preferred language. Here the 
main change is that, the board of the game is not 3 x 3 but 5 x 5. A player wins if he can match his drawn 
symbols in consecutive three cells either vertically or horizontally or diagonally, the generic winning 
constraint of the traditional 3 x 3 tic tac toe game. 
You will be given an initial configuration of the current status of the board including the human playerâ€™s last 
move. From that position, you need to make the game interactive between the PC and the human player 
by alternating their moves. Pc will give a move, then you will take input from the human player and again 
pc will give a move and so on. Pc will apply AI knowledge to pick up the move that will give him the best 
result.
